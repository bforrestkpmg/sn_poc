Where possible, it uses agreed RU’s or formulas as defined in the Telstra Qantas DNV MSA agreement.

It should be noted that all infrastructure costs are calculated over the useful life of the equipment which in this case is 8 years.

It should be noted that all service costs for each service are included for the life of the current DNV Contract following activation of new platform, which is currently expected to be 48 months.


Pricing Table Notes: 

1.	A Contract Variation will be executed between the parties to add the incremental charge to the existing ‘TWS Service 3 – Data Centre to Data Centre’ Resource Unit
