notes on formatting word docs


outcome required
extract text from word docs (and others in future)

question
can we extract table veratum using com model?

issues
save word doc as text, does not preserve table 'layout' e.g. we need tab between cells and each row on newline
saving as html we can covert to text but same problem, unless special regex logic to preserve td/tr
this regex \<(.|\n)*?\> replaces all

idea to maintain table format
convert file to html
strip out all carriage returns
convert </tr> to \n
convert </h1> to \n
convert <h1> to \n
convert </td> to \t
remove all tags replace('\<(.|\n)*?\>', "")




notes
this product (https://www.aspose.com/purchase/pricing-info-step-1-of-4.aspx) claims to have a 'preserve format' of tables in word doc but its $1000
this free package http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com provides DOM access model for content in html - can we 'just refer to the content' : to be tested
